[ðŸ”¼ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### Environment Configuration

To ensure flexibility and security, the application relies on environment variables for database configuration. Follow the steps below to set these variables:

#### Required Environment Variables:

- `DB_URL`: Database URL (e.g., `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/surveyhub`)
- `DB_USERNAME`: Database username (e.g., `root`)
- `DB_PASSWORD`: Database password (e.g., `YourStrongDatabasePassword`)

#### Setting Environment Variables

##### On Windows:

1. Open the Command Prompt with administrative privileges.
2. Use the `setx` command to add each variable:

   ```cmd
   setx DB_URL "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/surveyhub"
   setx DB_USERNAME "root"
   setx DB_PASSWORD "YourStrongDatabasePassword"
   ```

3. Restart the Command Prompt to ensure the variables are applied.

##### On Linux/macOS:

1. Open the terminal.
2. Edit your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) and add the following lines:

   ```bash
   export DB_URL="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/surveyhub"
   export DB_USERNAME="root"
   export DB_PASSWORD="YourStrongDatabasePassword"
   ```

3. Save the file and reload the shell configuration:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
   ```

#### Default Values

The application uses the following default values if no environment variables are detected. These defaults are defined in the utility class `EnvironmentConfig`:

```java
public static void loadEnvironmentVariables() {
    setSystemProperty("DB_URL", "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/surveyhub");
    setSystemProperty("DB_USERNAME", "root");
    setSystemProperty("DB_PASSWORD", "YourStrongDefaultDatabasePassword");
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Modify these defaults as needed to align with your deployment.

### Running the Application

1. Launch the application:

   ```bash
   java -jar target/surveyhub-desktop-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

2. Log in with your credentials to access the main dashboard.
